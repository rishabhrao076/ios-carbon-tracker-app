## Top 2 New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

### 1. Carbon Tracker (OCR App) — **[Winner]**
- **Description:** Users scan a bill/receipt and instantly see the carbon footprint of their purchase via on‑device OCR plus environmental‑impact data.  
- **Category:** Sustainability / Utility  
- **Mobile:** Relies on the camera and real‑time image processing—ideal for mobile.  
- **Story:** Makes low‑effort climate action possible: “Snap a receipt, know your impact.”  
- **Market:** Eco‑conscious consumers, climate‑tech enthusiasts, green‑loyalty programs.  
- **Habit:** Encourages a quick scan after each purchase; history and trends reinforce daily use.  
- **Scope:** MVP = camera → crop → OCR. Future = carbon analytics, streaks, social sharing, rewards.

### 2. Pokémon Pokédex App — **[Runner‑up]**
- **Description:** A companion app where users can search, browse, and bookmark Pokémon, view detailed stats, evolutions, and type match‑ups—complete with offline access and AR “view in room.”  
- **Category:** Reference / Entertainment  
- **Mobile:** Suits on‑the‑go look‑ups and camera‑based AR features.  
- **Story:** Gives trainers instant lore and battle info during gameplay or fandom discussions.  
- **Market:** Pokémon gamers, collectors, and fans of all ages.  
- **Habit:** Regular reference before or during game sessions; collectible aspects (e.g., AR badges) drive repeat visits.  
- **Scope:** MVP = search & details via public API. Future = offline cache, AR viewer, team builder, social sharing of teams.

## Conclusion
**Carbon Tracker (OCR App)** remains the top choice due to its meaningful impact and broad growth potential. The **Pokémon Pokédex App** is a strong second, appealing to a large fan base with opportunities for engaging features, but it doesn’t match the societal value and sustainability focus of Carbon Tracker.
